what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
Maybe a DIV for the board and then a DIV for each square within

how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
Style a div with CSS - set background color to red/blue and make it circular using the border-radius property


in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?
what might the flow of the game be?
Maybe an array of arrays

Flow would be:
Set board state to empty

When square is clicked, if square is empty add token style for player
Check for victory/tie
Switch player

Functions:
spotOpen - check column to see if there's an available spot for a token
checkVictory - check to see if four match up vertical/horizontal/diagonal
checkTie - check to see if entire grid is filled
